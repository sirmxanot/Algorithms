1. What is the binary search algorithm?
  A binary search algorithm takes a sorted list or array as input and then looks at the middle element, compares it to the element being searched for. If the middle element is larger than the target element, the algorithm will choose the element with an index half-way between the first element and the middle element. If the middle element is smaller than the target element then the algorithm will choose the element with an index half-way between the middle element and the last element as the next search location. This continues until the target element is either found, or the entire array has been searched.
