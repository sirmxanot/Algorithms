The Carboniferous Rainforest Collapse (CRC) was an extinction event that occurred around 305 million years ago in the Carboniferous period.
[1] Vast coal forests (so called because the compacted remains of the dense vegetation formed coal seams) covered the equatorial region of Euramerica (Europe and America). 
Climate change devastated tropical rainforests, fragmenting the forests into isolated 'islands' and causing the extinction of many plant and animal species.
The change was abrupt, happening during the Moscovian and Kasimovian stages of the Pennsylvanian.
